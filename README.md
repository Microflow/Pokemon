An app to help tree planting. There's a lot of social and political demand for reforestation initiatives.

>In China, extensive replanting programs have existed since the 1970s. Programs have had overall success. The forest cover has increased from 12% of China's land area to 16%. However, specific programs have had limited success. The "Green Wall of China", an attempt to limit the expansion of the Gobi Desert is planned to be 2,800 miles (4,500 km) long and to be completed in 2050. China plans to plant 26 billion trees in the next decade that is two trees for every Chinese citizen per year.[24] China requires that students older than 11 years old plant one tree a year until their high school graduation

The average British Columbian planter plants 1 600 trees per day,[5] but it is not uncommon for Hansbury to plant up to 4,000 trees per day while working in the interior.[4] These numbers are higher in central and eastern Canada, where the terrain is generally faster, however the price per tree is slightly lower as a result. Average daily totals of 2500 are common, with experienced planters planting upwards of 5000 trees a day. Numbers as high as 7500 a day have been recorded.[4] Planters typically work 8–10 hours per day with an additional 1 to 2 hours of (usually) unpaid traveling time.

Kaingaroa Forest is the largest forest in the North Island of New Zealand, and the largest plantation in the southern hemisphere.[citation needed]

The forest covers 2900 km² of the Bay of Plenty region, and stretches from Lake Taupo in the south to Kawerau to the north. The headquarters of the forest are at the small settlement of Kaingaroa, 50 kilometres southeast of Rotorua.[1] Prior to planting the area was a tussock and scrub plateau (ranging between 500 ft (150 m) and 2,481 ft (756 m) high), formed on volcanic ash.[2]

The forest was first planted in the late 1920s[3][4] and owned as a state asset by the New Zealand government.
