The average British Columbian planter plants 1 600 trees per day,[5] but it is not uncommon for Hansbury to plant up to 4,000 trees per day while working in the interior.[4] These numbers are higher in central and eastern Canada, where the terrain is generally faster, however the price per tree is slightly lower as a result. Average daily totals of 2500 are common, with experienced planters planting upwards of 5000 trees a day. Numbers as high as 7500 a day have been recorded.[4] Planters typically work 8â€“10 hours per day with an additional 1 to 2 hours of (usually) unpaid traveling time.
